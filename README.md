# LangGraph Multi-Agent Research Assistant

A sophisticated multi-agent system built with LangGraph for generating Wikipedia-like articles from scratch using Large Language Models (LLMs). This project implements the approach described in [Shao et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14207).

## Overview

This system creates a team of AI analysts with diverse expertise to collaboratively research and write comprehensive articles on any given topic. Each analyst brings unique perspectives and domain knowledge to ensure thorough coverage of the subject matter.

## Problems Solved

This project tackles several critical challenges in AI-powered content generation and research:

1. **Information Synthesis Challenge**:

   - Traditional LLMs struggle with comprehensive topic coverage
   - Single-perspective analysis often misses crucial viewpoints
   - Solution: Multi-expert system with diverse domain knowledge

2. **Source Reliability & Citations**:

   - Common issue of AI hallucinating or providing unreliable information
   - Difficulty in tracking and verifying sources
   - Solution: Automated source verification and citation management system

3. **Content Organization & Quality**:

   - Unstructured or poorly organized AI-generated content
   - Inconsistent writing style and depth
   - Solution: Wikipedia-style templating with standardized sections

4. **Expert Knowledge Integration**:

   - Limited domain expertise in single-model approaches
   - Lack of specialized perspective in complex topics
   - Solution: Dynamic team of AI analysts with complementary expertise

5. **Research Workflow Automation**:
   - Manual research process is time-consuming
   - Difficulty in maintaining consistency across sections
   - Solution: Automated research pipeline with quality control checks

## Tech Stack

- **Core Framework**: LangGraph for multi-agent orchestration
- **Language Models**:
  - OpenAI GPT-4
  - Groq LLM integration
- **Python Libraries**:
  - Pydantic for data modeling
  - Langchain for LLM interactions
  - dotenv for environment management
  - IPython for notebook interface
- **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebook/Lab

## Implementation Details

The system follows a multi-stage process:

1. **Agent Generation**: Creates a diverse team of AI analysts based on the topic
2. **Research Phase**: Each agent conducts specialized research in their domain
3. **Content Creation**: Collaborative article writing with structured sections
4. **Source Management**: Automatic citation and reference compilation
5. **Quality Control**: Multiple review passes for accuracy and completeness

## Features

- Dynamic team generation of AI analysts with specific roles and expertise
- Structured output using Pydantic models for consistent agent definitions
- Integration with OpenAI's GPT-4 and Groq models
- Collaborative article generation with multiple expert perspectives
- Automated source citation and reference management

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- OpenAI API key or Groq API key
- Required Python packages (specified in requirements.txt)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Create a `.env` file with your API keys:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```

## Usage

The main functionality is implemented in the Jupyter notebook `08_research_assistant.ipynb`. To use the system:

1. Open the notebook in Jupyter Lab/Notebook
2. Set your desired topic in the `TOPIC` variable
3. Run all cells sequentially
4. The system will generate a well-researched, Wikipedia-style article with proper citations

## Detailed Architecture

### 1. Agent System Architecture

The system implements a hierarchical multi-agent architecture:

```
[Topic Input] → [Agent Team Generator] → [Research Coordinator]
         ↓                                        ↓
[Expert Agents] ←→ [Knowledge Integration] ←→ [Quality Control]
         ↓                                        ↓
[Source Manager] → [Content Assembler] → [Final Article]
```

### 2. Agent Components

Each AI analyst is defined with:

- **Identity**:
  - Name and credentials
  - Institutional affiliation
  - Area of expertise
- **Capabilities**:
  - Research methodology
  - Domain knowledge scope
  - Writing style

### 3. System Components

- **Agent Team Generator**:

  - Analyzes topic requirements
  - Creates optimal team composition
  - Assigns specialized roles

- **Research Coordinator**:

  - Manages research workflow
  - Allocates subtopics
  - Ensures coverage completeness

- **Knowledge Integration Engine**:

  - Merges multiple expert inputs
  - Resolves conflicts
  - Maintains consistency

- **Source Manager**:
  - Validates references
  - Formats citations
  - Tracks source reliability

### 4. Quality Control System

- Multiple validation layers
- Cross-reference checking
- Style consistency enforcement
- Fact verification protocols

## Results and Performance

### Example Output: Apollo Missions Research

The system generated a comprehensive article on the Apollo Missions, demonstrating:

1. **Depth of Analysis**:

   - Technical specifications from engineering perspective
   - Historical context from space historians
   - Scientific achievements from research analysts

2. **Source Quality**:

   - 17+ verified references
   - Mix of academic and institutional sources
   - Proper citation formatting

3. **Content Structure**:

   - Well-organized sections
   - Clear progression of topics
   - Balanced coverage of technical and historical aspects

4. **Expert Integration**:
   - Multiple viewpoints incorporated
   - Consistent narrative flow
   - Complex concepts explained clearly

### Performance Metrics
